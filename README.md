# Tracking-PatientsApp
A program I did with my colleagues as a project at the university. Main idea of the program is to track the patients at the hospital, but there are other options aswell.
#
Those options are:
1. Sign a patient
2. Details about the patients
3. Details about the doctors
4. Visiting schedule
5. Details about the medicines
6. Add the medical ID
#
Here is how the app looks like (the app is currently in Bosnian language):
